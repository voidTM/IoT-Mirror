# Contribution Guidelines

Because its a MagicMirror plugin, you would need to clone the repo into the `modules` folder.

1. Clone the repo
2. `$ npm install`
3. Make sure you have a a sutiable `MMM-awesome-alexa` configuration
4. Write code
5. Build the project `$ npm run build`
6. Fire up `MagicMirror`
7. Once you are happy, create a Pull Request

Try and commit the TS files, and the dist in seperate commits

To test your changes, start the MagicMirror. Since, its already a `/module`, it will simply work.

**Important**: You need `devDependencies`, so make sure you `npm install`
